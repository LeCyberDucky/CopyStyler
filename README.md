# CopyStyler
Stylizes input code using pygments and pastes to clipboard

I use this script in Atom in combination with atom-shell-commands. I have setup a shortcut to exectue the script with the currently selected text as input. As a result, I can easily copy C++ snippets with correct formatting and syntax highlighting and paste into an OpenDocument object in word, in order to include code snippets in my notes.
